## Overview: 
### Using data from fictitious NYC bike-share company citibike, create proposal how the bike-share business can work in Des Moines, Idaho. Provide NCY bike trip analysis for stakeholders, to persuade them to fund a similar project in Des Moines.

#### Considerations:

#### •	User type: Customer or Subscriber

#### •	Gender: Male, Female, Unknown

#### •	Trip duration

#### •	Starting and Ending Locations

## Results: 
### 1.	Top Starting Locations: 
Some rides start outside of the inner city, but most are concentrated around the core of Manhattan, where there’s a higher concentration of businesses and tourist attractions.

### 2.	Top Ending Locations: 
Most rides end at the busiest locations in Manhattan, where there are lots of businesses where people are employed and tourists visit, including landmarks and restaurants. This map is very similar to the top starting locations, which may indicate the bikes aren’t generally taken a very far distance.

### 3.	Gender Breakdown: 
The majority of people that use the bikes identify as male.

### 4.	User Trips by Gender by Weekday: 
The heatmap shows that the majority of the use of the bikes were Subscribers, with Mon/Tues and Thurs/Fri having the darkest color intensity indicating the highest count of rides. Thurs/Fri were particularly busy are the busiest day for use among the male subscribers. Use during the week for Customers was steady for all genders, with a small increase of use over the weekend (Sat/Sun) as would be expected. This map shows that the people with the highest number of rides, which are primarily Subscribers, appear to use the service for the purpose of commuting to work.

### 5.	Trips by Weekday per Hour: 
Busiest time for bike rentals was between 7-9 am Monday through Friday, and between 5-7 pm, as we would expect the heaviest use to be at rush hour through the week. This indicates that people are using the bikes to commute to work. Also as expected, the use over the weekend (Sat-Sun) was pretty evenly distributed between 10 am – 6 pm.

### 6.	Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour): 
The use throughout the day has the same pattern for the male- and female-identified riders, but there was a lot more use from the male group. The busiest times are at 8 am, and between 5-6 pm. The Unknown group has the most rides on the weekends, between 11 am – 6 pm.

### 7.	Checkout Times for Users: 
This chart shows the checkout times, with minutes at the x-axis and the columns representing each subsequent hour.
Most Bikes are checked out for under 60 minutes, which we’d expect if people were using the bikes primarily for commuting to work; most people wouldn’t ride a bike over an hour to work every day.

### 8.	Checkout Times by Gender: 
This chart also shows the duration of each bike checkout, further broken down by “gender.” As per the previous plots, the male-identified group used the bike service the most; the numbers are almost triple the use from the other two gender groups represented in the dataset.

## Summary: 
The bikes appear to be used primarily for commutes to the work during the week, and for recreation on weekends. The highest number of Subscribers were the male-identified group and the use was highest during “rush” hours. For all gender-related data, the “unknown” group was minimal compared to the male-, and female-identified groups. In another city, such as Des Moines, stations can be located at busiest areas of traffic for people to use as commute to work. Also have more stations in areas that people like to walk around or sightsee, such as parks or waterfront, as well as commercial districts. The top starting and ending locations indicate that the highest use of these bikes are in the urban parts of the city. The rural areas have a lot less use, and won’t need as many bike stations.

### Charts for further analysis:
1.	Number of Rides vs Season or Temperatures: A line plot showing if there is a difference in the distribution of rides per season or daily temperature, and could assist with planning times to service bikes.
2.	Station locations: A map that shows landmarks and recreational facilities (indoor and outdoor) to determine if stations are distributed in the core areas we see the most bike use.
